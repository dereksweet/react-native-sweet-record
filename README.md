# react-native-sweet-record

An ActiveRecord style layer that sits on top of React Native's AsyncStorage.

### Introduction

Let me begin by saying that you'd have to be as bat shit crazy as a Donald Trump voter walking through Harlem with one of those bright red, obnoxious "Make America Great Again" hats to use react-native-sweet-record for any sort of large-scale persistent data storage project. It is intended to be used for hundreds of records, not thousands. If your requirements are of that magnitude please investigate other react native solutions with an actual database behind them. 

However, if you're looking for a bad-ass, mother-loving, salt-of-the-earth, ActiveRecord style library that doesn't require anything more than what the beautiful people behind the React Native AsyncStorage component have provided us then look no further. React-native-sweet-record is your huckleberry. 

You have concerns. I get it. That is not exactly a ringing endorsement. Not many project README's start out telling you that you're insane if you use them. Well, I can tell you that react-native-sweet-record has been used for all persistent data storage on [**"The Comedy Companion"**](https://github.com/dereksweet/ComedyCompanion), an app that is used by hundreds of stand-up comedians around the world, who all have hundreds of jokes, and not one of them has complained to me about the speed or reliability of the library. So, I decided to release it as a stand-alone project. I like it, I find it easy to use, and I'm hoping others do too!
